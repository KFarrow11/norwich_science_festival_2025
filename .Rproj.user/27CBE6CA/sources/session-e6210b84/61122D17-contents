## DATA PLOT/ preliminary investigations ----
# Create a scatter plot to look at the relationship between radiation 
ggplot(data= exposure_cancer, aes(x = exposure, y = cancer)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method='lm') # fit a line using the method linear model
  # conclusion = more exposure to radiation increases the probability of cancer mortality
# 2 points are outliers

# MODEL ----
# building model
model01 <- lm(cancer ~ exposure, data = exposure_cancer)
# Here we are creating a new object called model01
# In this object we are placing a linear model as described by the lm() function
# We are then specifying that we want to analyse cancer (our response variable) as a function of exposure (our predictor variable) using tilde (~). 
# We then just tell R which data frame we are using with the data = exposure_cancer argument. 

summary(model01) 
# Summary() will just print out a summary of our model for us to interpret.

## MODEL PLOT ---- 
ggplot(model01, aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0)

get_regression_points(model01)
# export regression points in a table of outcome/response variable, all explanatory/predictor variables, the fitted/predicted value, and residuals.
