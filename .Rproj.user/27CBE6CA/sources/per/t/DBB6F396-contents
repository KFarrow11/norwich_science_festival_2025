# üéØ  Objectives ----
# Hypotheses
# Diet nutritional quality affects body mass (condition).
# The effect of body condition on sexual signalling activity depends on nutritional quality diet.

# ü¶ó Brief intro to study ü¶ó ----
# No organism lives without expending energy. 
# Energy primarily supports internal metabolism, heat production and physical activity. Of these, physical activity can cause the most significant variation in the rate of energy expenditure. 
# Given that animals must always engage in some behaviour, even during periods of inactivity, the associated variation in energy expenditure is a crucial link between behaviour and overall fitness.

# üìë Aim ----
# To assess whether there is a relationship between total calling effort and change in body mass dependent upon diet acquisition.
